## Setting Up Your Own `pmcenter`

The following content will guide you through the installation process.

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft .NET Core (Runtime / SDK)
- Git (optional, not needed if you uses the binaries)

For officially supported operating systems, see [here](https://see.wtf/XxTlf).

For NOT officially supported operating systems, see [here](https://see.wtf/sIjUZ).

For Arch Linux, there's an official package.

For `Raspian` or other distributions based on `armv7` architecture, run this following script as `root`:

```bash
apt-get install curl libunwind8 gettext
curl -sSL -o dotnet.tar.gz https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/1/7/917308D9-6C92-4DA5-B4B1-B4A19451E2D2/dotnet-runtime-2.1.0-linux-arm.tar.gz
mkdir -p /opt/dotnet && sudo tar zxf dotnet.tar.gz -C /opt/dotnet
ln -s /opt/dotnet/dotnet /usr/local/bin
rm dotnet.tar.gz
dotnet --info
```

### Build `pmcenter` Yourself

**You need to install .NET Core _SDK_ and _Runtime_ to finish this.**

Run this script to clone, build and initiate your own `pmcenter`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Elepover/pmcenter.git --depth=1
cd pmcenter/pmcenter
dotnet restore
dotnet publish --configuration Release
cp -R bin/Release/netcoreapp2.1/publish ../
cd .. && mv publish build
cd build
dotnet pmcenter.dll
```

The compiled binaries will be put in the `pmcenter/build` folder in your working directory.

### Use Pre-compiled Binaries

**Only .NET Core _Runtime_ is required in this step.**

Run this script to download and initiate your own `pmcenter`:

```bash
mkdir pmcenter
cd pmcenter
wget https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/Elepover/pmcenter/artifacts/pmcenter.zip
unzip pmcenter.zip
dotnet pmcenter.dll
```

### Use Docker

DO NOT COPY & PASTE. You need to edit it before executing.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elepover/pmcenter/master/Dockfile
docker build . -t pmcenter
docker run -v PATH_OF_YOUR_pmcenter.json:/opt/pmcenter/pmcenter.json pmcenter
```

That's all.

## Configuring

During the first run, `pmcenter` will automatically generate the `pmcenter.json` and `pmcenter_locale.json` file for you. Change the settings to set up.

Or, use setup wizard:

`dotnet pmcenter.dll --setup`

*Note: Running `pmcenter` with `root` privileges is STRONGLY UNRECOMMENDED. We recommend you run pmcenter as a regular user.*

### `pmcenter` Settings

| `KeywordBanning` | `Boolean` | Decides whether the keyword banning feature is enabled or not. |
| `KeywordAutoBan` | `Boolean` | Automatically bans the matching user. |

| `DisableNotifications` | `Boolean` | Enable/Disable notifications. |

| `ServerPort` | `Int` | Server port. |
| `Username` | `String` | Proxy user name. |
| `ProxyPass` | `String` | Proxy password. |

Tip: After upgrades, you can send `/saveconf` command to the bot to fix missing new settings.

#### Note

- The variables like `$1` in the `Message_ReplySuccessful` and other keys could be safely deleted, if you like.
- **Emojis** are supported, and were used by default.
- Currently the response of the `/info` command is unchangeable.
- Familiar with another language? Pull requests are welcome!
- Please think twice before turning on `EnableMsgLink`, it makes it possible for you to reply to messages that are forwarded anonymously or from channels, however, it will cost more and more of your storage space and memory as the storage grows and makes it slower for pmcenter to process configuration files.

#### Changing File Location

On version 1.5.85.174 and later, pmcenter will check these two following environment variables on startup:

```
pmcenter_conf: pmcenter's configurations file's location.
pmcenter_lang: pmcenter's language file's location.
```

On these 3 scenarios, pmcenter will still use default location:

- The environment variable doesn't exist.
- The environment variable cannot be accessed.
- File not found.

## Starting

After all these, you can start your own `pmcenter` safely by using this command:

`dotnet pmcenter.dll`

You can write a `systemd service` to keep it running, even after the host machine's rebooting.
